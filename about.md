## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="picture.jpg">

Hi! I am an engineering student in Computer Science at [Ponts Paristech](http://www.enpc.fr/) and finished my Master program([MVA](http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/master-mva-cours-2016-2017-161721.kjsp?RH=1242415112528)) in **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** at ENS Paris Saclay. I am now between the LSCP and NPI at ENS Paris under the supervision of [Pr. Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/index.html) and [Pr. Anne-Catherine Bachoud-LÃ©vi](http://www.imrb.inserm.fr/equipes/ac-bachoud-levi/).


## Research

<!-- I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Languages Technologies, Computer Vision, Signal/Image Processing, Mapping systems and Statistics. -->

I like to see Computer Science, Mathematics and Machine Learning as a set of powerful tools providing new possibilities to Science, Healthcare and Education enabling us to shape the future and improve the lives of millions of people.

My current area of research is **Health Behavior Informatics** via Speech analysis. The goal is to build technologies to support clinical practice during diagnosis and treatment of the Huntington disease.
